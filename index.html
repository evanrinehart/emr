              <p>The year is 1990, and Odette DeLaporte has invited you to her study.  As the last remaining heir in New Orleans to the DeLaporte fortune, she needs your help locating a treasure which went missing a long time ago.  The reclusive matriarch has not been seen in public for quite some time, yet she has agreed to meet with you with the hope that you can recover what’s been lost.</p>
              <p>The Mardi Gras study features family heirlooms dating back to the earliest Carnival parades and enchanting objects which hold generations of family secrets.</p>

                        Escape My Room can be fun for kids as long as there is adult supervision. We do not recommend it for kids younger than 10, but all ages are permitted. For children under age 18, we require a <a href="https://app.waiverforever.com/pending/NjABoF8mS91435068281" target="_blank">liability form</a> signed by a parent or guardian. There are no discounts for children. In certain cases, children under age 15 may not require adult supervision; please inquire in advance with our offices via email at <a href="mailto:info@escapemyroom.com">info@escapemyroom.com.</a>

                        If Escape My Room were a movie, we think it would receive a PG rating. New Orleans is a city that has a dark history&mdash;slavery, prostitution, the mafia, and natural disasters. Some of those topics may be mentioned in the story of the rooms. If you have a specific concern, please write <a href="mailto:info@escapemyroom.com">us directly,</a> and we'll do our best to answer your question.

                        Escape My Room runs on a tight schedule which requires that participants arrive on time.  Please plan to arrive up to 15 minutes early which will give you time to explore the artifacts in our unique waiting room.  The time on your ticket is when you are supposed to be in the room solving puzzles, and it takes at least 5 minutes to give you an introduction and sign release waivers.  If you are later than the time on your ticket, you will have less time inside of the room.  Please call if you will arrive later than 10 minutes past the ticket time or you will forfeit your ticket and not be allowed into the room.
